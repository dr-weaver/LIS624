## Documentation outline:
A simple outline for documenting the work done on a project.  
The first line should be preceded with the appropriate heading level, depending on the structure of the file it is held within.

## __2026-02-08 - *Repository Creation*__

+ *Goal:*  
  Create a repository that will be used for LIS624
+ *Context:*  
  This is a required assignment for LIS624, as this repository will be used for the rest of the course.
+ *Steps:*  
  1. Create github account
  2. Create Repository
  3. Create README file for the repository
  4. Develop structure for README and subsequent documentation 
+ *Results:*  
  A repository has been created for future work for LIS624 and has a clear, organized structure for future documentation.
+ *Verification:*  
  Returning to the project several days after initial construction found that it was still in place as intended.
+ *Notes:*  
  - Documentation structure may change as the needs of the project become more clear.
  - [Section 2d] (https://cseanburns.github.io/systems-librarianship/2d-documenting-git-github-markdown.html) of the course text book outlines different code inputs for markdown language and can be referred to as needed.

## __2026-02-08 - *VM Connection*__

+ *Goal:*  
 Connect VM to git repo
+ *Context:*  
 This is a required assignment for LIS624. SSH connection must be established between the VM and repository in order to edit repo files within VM.
+ *Steps:*
 1. Configure git settings on VM.
 2. Create SSH key and add to github repository.
 3. Clone repo to VM.
 4. Stage, Commit, and Push repo.
+ *Results:*  
 VM and repo should now be connected, and files edited or created using the VM can be successfully pushed out to the repo.
+ *Verification:*
 After completing each of the steps outlined, the repo is checked to see if the edits done with the VM command line are evident.
+ *Notes:*
  - Text formatting is slightly off when done in VM. Need to continue to work with this at a later date to determine where issue lies.
